            <li>flex-direction: column:

               <li> The flex container's children are arranged vertically (from top to bottom).</li>
                <li>The main axis is the vertical axis (y-axis).</li>
                <li>The cross axis is the horizontal axis (x-axis).</li>

        <h3>Ques2.Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet        </h3>
        <h3>Inline Stylesheet: </h3>

            CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. <br>
            Example:
            <p style="color: red;">This is red text.</p>
        
        <h3>       Internal Stylesheet: </h3>

CSS is placed within the style tag inside the head section of the HTML document. <br>
Example:

  <style>
    p { color: blue; }
  </style>
<h3>External Stylesheet:</h3>

    CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML file using the link <br>

     
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <h3>Justify-content allows you to do what?    </h3>
 <p>
    justify-content is used in CSS to align and distribute space between items along the main axis (horizontal in row or vertical in column) of a flex container. It helps in positioning and spacing the items within the container.
<br>
Common values: <br>

<li>flex-start: Aligns items at the beginning.</li>
<li>flex-end: Aligns items at the end.</li>
<li>center: Centers the items.</li>
<li>space-between: Distributes items with equal space between them.</li>
<li>space-around: Distributes items with equal space around them.</li>

<h3> ques4. Difference between absolute and relative positionin</h3>
<h3>position: absolute:</h3> 
<p>The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, and it is removed from the document flow.</p>


<h3>Ques5.What is the z-index in CSS?</h3>
<p>z-index in CSS controls the stacking order of elements. <br> Higher z-index values are placed in front of lower values, <br>
     and it only works on elements with a position other than static.</p>

     <h3>Ques6.What is the difference between padding and margin?</h3>
     <p>
       <h3> Padding: </h3> 
       <p>space inside an element, between the content and its border. It increases the size of the element.</p>

<h3>Margin:</h3>
       <p>The space outside an element, between its border and neighboring elements. It does not affect the element's size.</p>
